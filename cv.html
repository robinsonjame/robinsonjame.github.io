<p>The paper explores how the Communist Party USA, at the height of its influence in the 1930s-40s, used sports to further a party social life and make connections between radical political organizing and everyday life of regular Americans, specifically through the sponsorship of Communist sports teams and Communist-influenced leagues, particularly baseball and basketball, through their influence in CIO and progressive unions, the Young Communist League, and the fraternal International Workers Order. The paper makes a case for the playing of sports as a tool in building progressive sports culture.</p>
